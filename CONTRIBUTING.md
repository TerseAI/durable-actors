# Contributing to Durable Actors

We welcome bug reports, documentation improvements, examples, and code contributions. For a larger change, open an [issue](https://github.com/TerseAI/durable-actors/issues) to discuss the approach before starting. Small fixes can go straight to a pull request.

Please follow our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Report vulnerabilities privately through [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Set up the repository

To use Durable Actors in your own application, start with the [quickstart](README.md#local-development). To develop this repository, install:

- Node.js 22.19+ and pnpm 10.17.1 (the pinned workspace version).
- Bun 1.3.9+; CI exercises both 1.3.9 and 1.4.2.
- Rust 1.89+ with Cargo and rustfmt, and a native C/C++ build toolchain.
- Go for changes to `providers/modal-go` or a full runtime bundle. CI uses Go 1.27.1; the module declares Go 1.25.0.
- PostgreSQL 16 for database tests. Docker is an optional way to run it.

Fork the repository, then clone your fork and install the workspace dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/durable-actors.git
cd durable-actors
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm --dir sdk build
cargo build --locked
```

The SDK build includes the observer UI and actor template. A full native bundle, including the Go provider, can be built with `pnpm build`.

## Make a change

Keep changes focused and follow the [engineering conventions](AGENTS.md). For behavior changes, add a failing test first, implement the change, then refactor. Put tests and fixtures in the relevant project's `tests/` directory; CLI tests belong in `sdk/tests/cli/`. Rust unit tests use `#[path]` declarations to retain private access. Go tests use the existing overlay; update `providers/modal-go/tests/overlay.json` when adding or renaming tests.

Update documentation and examples when changing a public API, configuration, or CLI behavior.

## Run checks

From the repository root:

```sh
pnpm format:check
pnpm test
pnpm docs:check
```

`pnpm test` covers the observer UI, repository scripts, Rust tests, and SDK. PostgreSQL tests skip their database work unless `DURABLE_ACTORS_TEST_POSTGRES_URL` is set. Use a dedicated test database; the suite creates and removes test schemas. For example, with Docker:

```sh
docker run --name durable-actors-test-postgres --rm -d \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=durable_actors_test \
  -p 127.0.0.1:5432:5432 postgres:16
docker exec durable-actors-test-postgres pg_isready -U postgres -d durable_actors_test
export DURABLE_ACTORS_TEST_POSTGRES_URL='postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/durable_actors_test?sslmode=disable'
pnpm test
```

Wait until `pg_isready` reports that PostgreSQL is accepting connections before running the tests. Stop the disposable database with `docker stop durable-actors-test-postgres` when finished.

For runtime and integration changes, build the SDK and runtime, then run the opt-in tests with Bun on your PATH:

```sh
pnpm --dir sdk build
cargo build --locked
cargo test --locked -- --ignored
```

For Go provider changes, run from `providers/modal-go`:

```sh
go test -race -mod=readonly -overlay tests/overlay.json ./...
go vet -mod=readonly -overlay tests/overlay.json ./...
```

For SDK packaging or documentation changes, run the relevant checks:

```sh
pnpm --dir sdk package:check
pnpm --dir packages/observer-ui package:check
pnpm docs:build
```

The [CI workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yml) is the source of truth for toolchain versions and the full validation matrix.

## Open a pull request

Describe the problem, the resulting behavior, and how you verified it. Link related issues and include screenshots for UI changes. Note any checks you could not run. Maintainers will review the change and arrange releases through the existing [release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml).
