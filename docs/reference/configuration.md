# Environment variables

The CLI reads `.env` in the current directory. Exported variables take precedence. Application backends must load their own environment; containers can use `--env-file`.

## Application connection

Used by backend clients, `generate --remote`, and `observe`. Local startup also uses the project ID and API key.

| Variable                           | Default                                             | Meaning                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DURABLE_ACTORS_PROJECT_ID`        | `local` on localhost; required remotely             | Actor project ID; use the same value in the server registration and backend.                                                |
| `DURABLE_ACTORS_CONTROL_PLANE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:7100`                             | HTTP(S) server origin. Paths, query strings, fragments, and embedded credentials are not allowed.                           |
| `DURABLE_ACTORS_SECRET`            | Unset                                               | Optional shared secret. Set the same value on the server and backend to enable authentication. Keep it out of browser code. |

Local CLI commands and backend clients need no connection settings with the defaults. Connections to localhost (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, and `[::1]`) default to project `local`. Remote connections require an explicit project ID. If you override the project or port, use matching settings in your backend.

Authentication is disabled when `DURABLE_ACTORS_SECRET` is unset on the server, locally or remotely. Set it on both the server and your backend to test or enable authentication. Clients omit the authorization header when no secret is configured. Leave the variable unset to disable authentication; empty values and surrounding whitespace are invalid on the server.

## Local development

Used by `dev`.

| Variable                    | Default                     | Meaning                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DURABLE_ACTORS_PROJECT`    | `.`                         | Actor project directory.                                                                                              |
| `DURABLE_ACTORS_ENTRYPOINT` | `src/actors.ts`             | Actor source file, relative to the project.                                                                           |
| `DURABLE_ACTORS_PORT`       | `7100`                      | Listening port; `0` selects a free port. `--port` overrides it for one run.                                           |
| `DURABLE_ACTORS_DATA_DIR`   | `<project>/.durable-actors` | Persistent local state directory.                                                                                     |
| `DURABLE_ACTORS_STORAGE`    | `local`                     | `local` for file storage or `gcs` for a GCS bucket. GCS also requires `DURABLE_ACTORS_BUCKET` and Google credentials. |

## Server hosting

The server requires a `DURABLE_ACTORS_CONTROL_PLANE_URL` reachable by its actor hosts and clients, which may be on a private network.

`DURABLE_ACTORS_SECRET` is optional for `durable-actors start`, the native executable, and the container. When the listening address is not localhost and no secret is configured, startup warns that anyone who can reach the server can access its API, then continues. The SDK also accepts `DURABLE_ACTORS_API_KEY`, with `DURABLE_ACTORS_SECRET` taking precedence. Internal actor and storage credentials are still required and are managed separately.

| Variable                            | Default                                                 | Meaning                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DURABLE_ACTORS_PROCESS_ROLE`       | CLI `start`: `control_plane`; native executable: `host` | Set to `control_plane` when running the server container.                          |
| `DURABLE_ACTORS_CONTROL_PLANE_BIND` | `127.0.0.1:7100`                                        | Listening address. Use `0.0.0.0:7100` inside a container.                          |
| `DURABLE_ACTORS_POSTGRES_URL`       | Required                                                | PostgreSQL connection URL. The database user must be able to run migrations.       |
| `DURABLE_ACTORS_BUCKET`             | Required                                                | GCS bucket name without `gs://`. Also required for local GCS storage.              |
| `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`    | Google Application Default Credentials                  | Path to a service-account credentials file; omit with an attached Google identity. |
| `DURABLE_ACTORS_SANDBOX_PROVIDER`   | Required                                                | Supported value: `modal`.                                                          |
| `DURABLE_ACTORS_RUNTIME_IMAGE`      | Required                                                | Shared Modal runtime image ID (`im-...`), matching the SDK version.                |
| `MODAL_TOKEN_ID`                    | Required                                                | Token ID for the Modal workspace containing your images.                           |
| `MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET`                | Required                                                | Modal token secret.                                                                |
| `DURABLE_ACTORS_JWT_SIGNING_KEY`    | Required; generated for local development               | Base64-encoded Ed25519 PKCS#8 signing key. Reuse across restarts.                  |

When importing the runtime image into Modal, clear its Docker entrypoint with `modal.Image.from_registry(..., add_python="3.12").entrypoint([])` so the provider can run its build, actor, and replica commands.

## Advanced settings

### Capacity and placement

| Variable                                    | Default              | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DURABLE_ACTORS_HOST_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS`      | `10000`              | Actor idle time before eviction; 1–86400000 ms. Applies locally too. Method calls and WebSocket messages reset the timer; running handlers defer eviction. Open WebSockets retain the host and connections, but not the actor instance. Without open sockets, an idle host shuts down. |
| `DURABLE_ACTORS_HOST_STARTUP_MS`            | `10000`              | Positive actor-host startup timeout in milliseconds.                                                                                                                                                            |
| `DURABLE_ACTORS_SPARE_IDLE`                 | `5`                  | Minimum ready + starting spares per role, runtime image, region, and resource configuration; 0–32. Zero disables background warming. Named Modal secrets bypass the actor pool. |
| `DURABLE_ACTORS_SPARE_MAX`                  | `32`                 | Maximum unassigned capacity per pool; 0–128, at least `SPARE_IDLE`. Set equal to `SPARE_IDLE` for a fixed target. |
| `DURABLE_ACTORS_SPARE_FLEET_MAX`            | `64`                 | Shared unassigned-capacity limit across actor and replica pools using the same PostgreSQL database; 0–4096, at least `SPARE_IDLE`. This cap takes precedence over pool minimums. |
| `DURABLE_ACTORS_SPARE_MAX_STARTING`         | `8`                  | Maximum concurrent background spare builds across the fleet; 1–128. |
| `DURABLE_ACTORS_SPARE_SHRINK_SECONDS`       | `300`                | Time lower demand must persist before reducing a target; 30–3600 seconds. Subsequent reductions remove 10% (rounded up) once per minute. |
| `DURABLE_ACTORS_SPARE_REGIONS`              | `north-america-east` | Comma-separated regions for ready actor hosts.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `DURABLE_ACTORS_SPARE_TTL_SECONDS`          | `600`                | Unassigned host lifetime; 30–3600 seconds.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `DURABLE_ACTORS_HOST_CPU_MILLIS`            | `1000`               | Actor CPU request and cap; 100–64000 millicores.                                                                                                                                                                |
| `DURABLE_ACTORS_HOST_MEMORY_MIB`            | `1024`               | Actor memory request and cap; 128–262144 MiB.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `DURABLE_ACTORS_REPLICA_REGIONS`            | `[]`                 | JSON list of up to eight replica regions; duplicates allowed. Empty uses object storage only.                                                                                                                   |
| `DURABLE_ACTORS_REGION`                     | Unset                | Default region for new actors. Explicit assignments must match it; existing actors keep their saved home.                                                                                                       |
| `DURABLE_ACTORS_HOME_REGION`                | Unset                | Region requested by a trusted backend. Omit to use the actor's saved home or the server default.                                                                                                                |

Servers sharing PostgreSQL must use matching pool settings. Targets grow immediately from the larger of the last 10-second and 60-second acquisition rates, plus burst headroom. The forecast covers p95 replacement time plus one second; p95 uses the latest 100 successful spare builds from the last ten minutes, or ten seconds before samples exist. Recent peak demand is measured over the same refill window within the last minute. Pool misses count as demand; calls to an already-active actor do not.

Replacements start in the background across pools, including before ready spares expire when capacity allows. Healthy builds already in progress count toward the target. Failed builds back off exponentially, up to 32 seconds. Shared limits include retiring unassigned sandboxes until termination succeeds; they do not limit assigned actors or on-demand creation. Target changes are logged as `spare pool target changed`.

### Authentication and callbacks

| Variable                                | Default                              | Meaning                                                                                |

| `DURABLE_ACTORS_SOCKET_EVENT_URL`       | Disabled                             | Incoming-message callback URL. Callbacks send the shared secret when configured and omit authorization otherwise; see [OpenAPI](openapi.yaml).                            |

### Diagnostics and runtime overrides

| Variable                         | Default                   | Meaning                                                                                        |
