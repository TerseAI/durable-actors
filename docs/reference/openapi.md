# OpenAPI

The [OpenAPI specification](openapi.yaml) describes the HTTP endpoints, authentication, request bodies, and responses.

Download the specification from a running server:

```sh
curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:7100/openapi.yaml -o openapi.yaml
```

Replace the origin with your hosted server's URL when needed. Import the file into an OpenAPI-compatible API client or documentation viewer.

The specification is public. Authenticated endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <api-key>`; use your backend's `DURABLE_ACTORS_SECRET` and keep it out of browser code.
