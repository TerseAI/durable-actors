# Python guide

## Before you start

Install Python 3.11+ and uv. The CLI installs its matching native runtime through a platform wheel for Linux or macOS, on x64 or ARM64.

Create a new project in any directory:

```bash
uvx --from 'durable-actors[cli]' durable-actors init my-bank
cd my-bank
```

The generated project keeps the SDK in production dependencies and CLI tools in its development dependency group. `uv run` installs both; no repository checkout or Rust compiler is needed.

## Defining an actor

Each bank account is an actor. An actor has fields and methods. `persisted()` saves a field after each successful method call.

To track a bank balance, define `src/actors.py`:

```python
from durable_actors import Actor, persisted


class BankAccount(Actor):
    _balance: int = persisted(0)

    def get_balance(self) -> int:
        return self._balance
```

## Generating a client

Start the local dev server from `my-bank`. The first run downloads the runtime:

```bash
uv run durable-actors dev
```

Wait for `Ready`, then generate the client in a second terminal opened in the same `my-bank` directory:

```bash
uv run durable-actors generate
```

This creates a `generated` package with typed stubs for your actors. Each actor instance is addressed by an ID. Create a `client.py` that gets the `demo` account and calls a method:

```python
from generated import actors

account = actors.BankAccount.get("demo")
print(account.get_balance())
```

Run the client with Python:

```bash
uv run client.py
```

It prints `0`. The server and client both use `http://127.0.0.1:7100` by default.

An actor starts when one of its methods is called, stays in memory while it is busy, and shuts down after sitting idle. Regenerate the client after changing an actor's methods.

## Ephemeral fields

Next, count the deposits made since the actor last woke up. `ephemeral()` keeps a field in memory only while the actor is awake. It resets when the actor shuts down.

```python
from durable_actors import Actor, ephemeral, persisted


class BankAccount(Actor):
    _balance: int = persisted(0)
    _deposits_since_wake: int = ephemeral(0)

    def get_balance(self) -> int:
        return self._balance

    def get_deposits_since_wake(self) -> int:
        return self._deposits_since_wake

    def deposit(self, amount: int) -> int:
        self._balance += amount
        self._deposits_since_wake += 1
        return self._balance
```

## WebSocket messages

Socket authorization is checked when connecting. The grant's `connect_by_ms` deadline limits when a connection can open; an accepted socket remains authorized until it closes, including while the actor sleeps. Reconnects require a valid grant. To revoke an existing connection, explicitly close it.

Actors handle WebSocket connections directly. The three type parameters of `Actor` describe each connection. Payloads are JSON.

- **Metadata** identifies the client. In this example, it is the `user_id` passed when the client connects.
- **Incoming** messages are what a client can send. Here, `{"type": "ping"}`, which `on_message` answers with the balance.
- **Outgoing** messages are what the actor sends, through either `socket.send` or `broadcast`. Here, `{"type": "balance", "balance": ...}`.

The example also uses:

- **Tags.** `set_tags` labels one socket. `on_connect` tags each socket `"customer"`.
- **Automatic responses.** The gateway answers a raw text `ping` with `pong` without waking the actor. `on_connect` registers the pair. A JSON `{"type": "ping"}` still runs `on_message`.
- **Broadcasts.** `broadcast` sends to every connected socket. `deposit` limits it to sockets tagged `"customer"`, and `on_disconnect` uses `except_ids` to skip the socket that just left.
- **Individual sends.** `socket.send` sends to one socket. `on_connect` and `on_message` use it to send that client the current balance.

```python
from typing import Literal

from durable_actors import Actor, ActorSocket, ephemeral, persisted
from pydantic import BaseModel


class Metadata(BaseModel):
    user_id: str


class Incoming(BaseModel):
    type: Literal["ping"]


class Outgoing(BaseModel):
    type: Literal["balance"]
    balance: int


Socket = ActorSocket[Metadata, Outgoing]


class BankAccount(Actor[Metadata, Incoming, Outgoing]):
    _balance: int = persisted(0)
    _deposits_since_wake: int = ephemeral(0)

    def get_balance(self) -> int:
        return self._balance

    def get_deposits_since_wake(self) -> int:
        return self._deposits_since_wake

    def deposit(self, amount: int) -> int:
        self._balance += amount
        self._deposits_since_wake += 1
        self.broadcast(Outgoing(type="balance", balance=self._balance), tags=("customer",))
        return self._balance

    def on_connect(self, socket: Socket) -> None:
        socket.set_tags("customer")
        self.set_websocket_auto_response("ping", "pong")
        socket.send(Outgoing(type="balance", balance=self._balance))

    def on_message(self, socket: Socket, message: Incoming) -> None:
        socket.send(Outgoing(type="balance", balance=self._balance))

    def on_disconnect(self, socket: Socket, code: int, reason: str, was_clean: bool) -> None:
        self.broadcast(Outgoing(type="balance", balance=self._balance), except_ids=(socket.id,))
```

## Emitting state

`emitted()` publishes a public `persisted()` field to every connected client, so `_balance` becomes `balance`:

- When a client connects, it receives a `StateSnapshot` with the current emitted fields, here `message.state.balance`.
- After a successful call changes the field, clients receive a `StateUpdate` with the changes.

```python
from typing import Literal

from durable_actors import Actor, ActorSocket, emitted, ephemeral, persisted
from pydantic import BaseModel


class Metadata(BaseModel):
    user_id: str


class Incoming(BaseModel):
    type: Literal["ping"]


class Outgoing(BaseModel):
    type: Literal["balance"]
    balance: int


Socket = ActorSocket[Metadata, Outgoing]


class BankAccount(Actor[Metadata, Incoming, Outgoing]):
    balance: int = emitted(persisted(0))
    _deposits_since_wake: int = ephemeral(0)

    def get_balance(self) -> int:
        return self.balance

    def get_deposits_since_wake(self) -> int:
        return self._deposits_since_wake

    def deposit(self, amount: int) -> int:
        self.balance += amount
        self._deposits_since_wake += 1
        self.broadcast(Outgoing(type="balance", balance=self.balance), tags=("customer",))
        return self.balance

    def on_connect(self, socket: Socket) -> None:
        socket.set_tags("customer")
        self.set_websocket_auto_response("ping", "pong")
        socket.send(Outgoing(type="balance", balance=self.balance))

    def on_message(self, socket: Socket, message: Incoming) -> None:
        socket.send(Outgoing(type="balance", balance=self.balance))

    def on_disconnect(self, socket: Socket, code: int, reason: str, was_clean: bool) -> None:
        self.broadcast(Outgoing(type="balance", balance=self.balance), except_ids=(socket.id,))
```

A connecting client sees the snapshot, then updates as deposits land:

```python
from durable_actors import StateSnapshot, StateUpdate
from generated import actors

account = actors.BankAccount.get("demo")
with account.connect(actors.BankAccount.Metadata(user_id="ada")) as socket:
    for message in socket:
        if isinstance(message, StateSnapshot):
            print(message.state.balance)
        elif isinstance(message, StateUpdate):
            print(message.changes.balance)
        else:
            print(message)
```

## Interleaving calls

An actor runs one call at a time by default. Python methods run in a worker thread, and an `@interleave` method does not hold the actor while it runs: other calls can start at any point during it, not only while it waits on I/O. Protect state that overlapping calls share, for example with a `threading.Lock` in an `ephemeral()` field.

Add a second actor for wire transfers to `src/actors.py`:

```python
from durable_actors import Actor, emitted, interleave, persisted


class ClearingNetwork:
    def submit(self, reference: str) -> str:
        return f"receipt:{reference}"


clearing_network = ClearingNetwork()


class Wire(Actor):
    status: str = emitted(persisted("requested"))

    def get_status(self) -> str:
        return self.status

    @interleave
    def submit(self, reference: str) -> str:
        receipt = clearing_network.submit(reference)
        self.status = "submitted"
        return receipt
```

`get_status` can run while `submit` is still in progress.

Interleaving changes failure handling for the whole class. A failed call normally rolls back its field and SQLite changes. Once any method in a class uses `@interleave`, no call in that class rolls back, because overlapping calls may already have used the changes.

## Using SQLite

Each actor has its own SQLite database at `self.db`. `self.db.exec(sql, *bindings)` runs one statement and returns its rows as dictionaries. Here, `deposit` records each deposit in a ledger table:

```python
from durable_actors import Actor, emitted, persisted


class BankAccount(Actor):
    balance: int = emitted(persisted(0))

    def deposit(self, amount: int) -> int:
        self.db.exec("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ledger (amount INTEGER)")
        self.balance += amount
        self.db.exec("INSERT INTO ledger (amount) VALUES (?)", amount)
        return self.balance
```

- SQL writes and `persisted()` fields commit together when the method or socket hook succeeds.
- Bind values with `?` placeholders. Values can be `str`, `int`, `float`, `bytes`, or `None`.
- `self.db` is available only while a method or socket hook runs.
- The runtime owns transactions and the database file, so `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `END`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`, `RELEASE`, `ATTACH`, `DETACH`, and `VACUUM` are rejected.
- The only allowed PRAGMAs are `table_info`, `table_xinfo`, `index_info`, `index_xinfo`, `index_list`, `foreign_key_list`, `foreign_key_check`, `integrity_check`, `quick_check`, and `user_version`.
- Names beginning with `__terse_` or `_litestream_` are reserved.

## Configuring actor resources

`@compute` overrides the deployment's default resources for one actor class:

```python
from durable_actors import Actor, compute, emitted, persisted


@compute(cpu=0.5, memory_mib=256, idle_timeout_ms=60_000)
class BankAccount(Actor):
    balance: int = emitted(persisted(0))
```
