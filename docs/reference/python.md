## Actor definitions

Extend `Actor` directly with typed `def` methods and field defaults; prefix helper methods with `_`. Every instance field must have a type annotation and use exactly one of `persisted()` or `ephemeral()`, including private fields. Wrap a public persisted field with `emitted()` to broadcast changes. Unmarked fields are rejected; `ClassVar` attributes are excluded from state.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from durable_actors import Actor, emitted, ephemeral, persisted

class Message(BaseModel):
    text: str = Field(min_length=1)

class Chat(Actor):
    messages: list[Message] = emitted(persisted(default_factory=list))
    busy: bool = ephemeral(False)

    def append(self, message: Message) -> list[Message]:
        self.messages.append(message)
        return self.messages
```

## SQLite

Inside a method or socket hook, `self.db.exec(sql, *bindings)` returns row dictionaries for one statement. `self.db.execute(sql, *bindings)` accepts a SQL script atomically and returns `SqliteResult(rows, rows_written)`; only the final statement accepts bindings and contributes results. Write counts include triggers and foreign-key actions and are zero for reads.

`self.db.transaction_sync(callback)` runs synchronous SQL in a nested savepoint. A thrown callback rolls back its SQL, but not actor fields or external effects. Releasing a savepoint does not commit the invocation: SQL and persisted fields commit together after success and roll back together on ordinary invocation failure. Reentrant actors share state and cannot roll back failed invocations. The runtime reserves names containing `__terse_` or `_litestream_` and owns transaction control, database files, and storage pragmas.

## Types and clients

Use concrete types at public boundaries: JSON primitives, typed collections, unions, models, dataclasses, dates, or UUIDs; `Any` and bare collections are rejected. Generated clients validate values and expose models and method types through the actor namespace.

```python
from generated import actors

chat: actors.Chat.Stub = actors.Chat.get("lobby")
messages: actors.Chat.Methods.append.Result = chat.append(actors.Chat.Message(text="hello"))
print(messages[0].text)
```

If you copy a client into another application, copy the entire generated package, including its helper modules, and install its runtime dependency from that application's root:

```sh
uv add durable-actors
```

Each application that runs a generated client must declare `durable-actors`. Its runtime dependencies are installed automatically; the `[codegen]` extras are only needed to generate or regenerate clients, not to run them.

## State subscriptions

Callbacks receive complete typed snapshots of emitted fields on a background thread. Failures stop the subscription and reach `on_error`; use `with` to close it.

```python
with chat.subscribe(lambda state: print(state.messages), on_error=print):
    chat.append(actors.Chat.Message(text="hello"))
    input("Press Enter to stop.\n")
```

## Execution and failures

Calls serialize and roll back persisted state on failure by default. `@reentrant` allows overlapping threads and disables rollback for the entire class; protect shared mutations with an ephemeral lock.

```python
import time
from threading import Lock
from durable_actors import Actor, ephemeral, persisted, reentrant

class Counter(Actor):
    count: int = persisted(0)
    _lock: Lock = ephemeral(default_factory=Lock)

    def increment(self) -> int:
        with self._lock:
            self.count += 1
            return self.count

    @reentrant
    def wait(self, seconds: float) -> str:
        time.sleep(seconds)
        return self.id
```

An `ActorInvocationError` with code `outcome_unknown` means the call may have executed; replaying it can repeat side effects.

## Typed WebSockets

`Actor[Metadata, Incoming, Outgoing]` types the connection and its messages. This `Room` uses the `Message` model above.

```python
from durable_actors import ActorSocket

class Member(BaseModel):
    name: str

class Room(Actor[Member, Message, Message]):
    def on_message(self, socket: ActorSocket[Member, Message], message: Message) -> None:
        self.broadcast(Message(text=f"{socket.metadata.name}: {message.text}"))
```

Regenerate after adding `Room`, then connect with its required metadata. Connections also deliver `StateSnapshot` and `StateUpdate` events when an actor emits state.

For authoritative acknowledgments, use `socket.send_after_commit(message)` or `self.broadcast_after_commit(message, ...)`. The host sends them only after state is durable and discards them on invocation failure; ordinary sends still stream immediately. The output queue is bounded to 512 effects and 24 MiB. These sends do not guarantee receipt or replay: persist pending messages with stable IDs, replay on reconnect, deduplicate repeated events, and remove pending messages only after acknowledgment.

```python
from generated import actors
from durable_actors import StateSnapshot, StateUpdate

room = actors.Room.get("lobby")
with room.connect(actors.Room.Metadata(name="Ada")) as connection:
    connection.send(actors.Room.Incoming(text="hello"))
    for event in connection:
        if isinstance(event, (StateSnapshot, StateUpdate)):
            print(event)
        else:
            print(event.text)
```

## CLI and configuration

The shared Node CLI uses the project's `.venv` and runs strict mypy on actor definitions and generated clients. Keep the CLI, Python SDK, and native runtime versions aligned.

```sh
pnpm add -D durable-actors
uv add 'durable-actors[codegen]'
pnpm exec durable-actors dev
```

Generate in another terminal, from the running server or a trusted source file:

```sh
pnpm exec durable-actors generate --language python
pnpm exec durable-actors generate src/actors.py --out-dir generated
```

Clients default to project `local` at `http://127.0.0.1:7100`; explicit `Client` options override environment settings. See [configuration](configuration.md) for server settings, and use `DURABLE_ACTORS_PYTHON` to select another interpreter.

```python
from durable_actors import Client

with Client(control_plane_url="http://127.0.0.1:7100", project_id="local") as client:
    chat = actors.Chat.get("lobby", client)
    print(chat.append(actors.Chat.Message(text="hello")))
```

## Source references and broadcasts

When actor source is available, call it directly without generation. Backend broadcasts send application messages without persisting them.

```python
from src.actors import Chat, Message, Room

print(Chat.get("lobby").append(Message(text="hello")))
Room.get("lobby").broadcast(Message(text="announcement"))
```

## Browser access

Authenticate the user and check room access before issuing a WebSocket grant. Treat its URL as a credential.

```python
from generated import actors, ActorProxy

access = actors.Room.Authorization(
    actor_id="lobby",
    metadata=actors.Room.Metadata(name="Ada"),
)
grant = ActorProxy.handle(access)
```

## Sandbox resources

Override deployment defaults per actor; see [configuration](configuration.md#per-actor-sandbox-overrides) for limits and placement rules.

```python
from durable_actors import Actor, persisted, sandbox

@sandbox(cpu=2, memory_mib=2048, regions=["canada"], idle_timeout_ms=60_000)
class CustomerAgent(Actor):
    count: int = persisted(0)

    def increment(self) -> int:
        self.count += 1
        return self.count
```

## Deployment

Compile a Python project with `python -m durable_actors.build PROJECT ENTRYPOINT OUTPUT`, upload the resulting `actors.pyz` to GCS, and register its `bundle` manifest and the compiler's contract through the [HTTP API](openapi.md). Dependencies must match the runtime's SDK version. Include extra resources in `pyproject.toml` and load them with `importlib.resources`:

```toml
[tool.durable-actors]
include = ["templates/*.txt", "data/*.json"]
```

Use editor hover or `help()` for full API signatures, including `ActorSessionTransport` for renewable sessions and `ActorInvocationError` for failures.
